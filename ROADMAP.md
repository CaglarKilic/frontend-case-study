I enjoyed working on this exercise. I especially liked the messaging over letter part.

If I had the time, I would definitely add more features. Just to name a few:
- Add an LLM service to learn from HR team's earlier offers and generate offers based on these templates and/or keywords.
- Add filtering capabilities to dashboard. Ordering, full-text search, etc...
- Add expiry date to offers and time based notifications. Both visual and toaster style.
- Add notification when a candidate sends a message back with the letter.
- Add useful links to offer letter to explain relatively complicated compensations like stock options.

Overall this can be an MVP in a week or two.
