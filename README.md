# 1. Introduction
I built a dashboard oriented HR offer letter crud app POC with a basic header-sidebar-main layout.

# 2. Set-Up
```
npm run install
npm run demo
```
After this, go to http://localhost:5173/ in your web browser.

**For testing:**
```
npm run test
```
***Note:***
- Please run tests after running the demo in another terminal or `npm run server` first. I didn't mock db to keep things simple.

# 3. Notes
- Instead of Lorem Ipsum, static text contents in components are generated by LLM manually only once.
- Unique links are generated by json-server.
- Used data APIs of React Router. All loading and actions are defined in the ./src/routes.jsx.
- Tests are not 100% coverage but cover if components render successfully after initial load and user navigation.
